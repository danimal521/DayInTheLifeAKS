# Module 1: Getting to know your Guerrilla

## Overview
Azure Kubernetes Service is large and has many facets to it. There is a lot to learn and understand and this can be daunting and intimidating. Let's demystify this and get to know our guerrilla!

At its core, let's think of AKS as a simple virtual machine. Let's think of containers like a simple application. Now we just have to copy our application to the virtual macing to run the app. Thatâ€™s it, at the core this is all we are doing and what the whole system is designed to do. 

Now, take many years of software evolution and design. Outages, software management and devops. Scale and cloud compute and you end up with an platform that can handle any compute/application need and at scale. This is where things get a little more complicated, but it does not have to be. Always remember it's just about running applications.

Let's jump in! In this module we will connect to an AKS cluster and look around.

## Step 1: Connect to Azure
Our first step is to login to Azure with the CLI

```bash
az login
```

Then we have to make sure we set the environment to the correct subscription

```bash
az account set --subscription <your sub>
```

## Step 2: Connect to AKS
From the portal, navigate to your AKS cluster. You will need the cluster name and the resource group it was created in.

Then connect to your cluster.

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <your RG> --name <your cluster name>
```

## Step 3: Let's look around

One of the first things to look at in a cluster are the namespaces. Namespaces are isolation layers in AKS, think of different groupings of applications or subject areas. Many also use it for different deployment tiers such as Development, UAT and Production.

The tool we use to interact with AKS is kubectl. 

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

Result: This is a new, blank cluster. By default there will be a few namespaces deployed.

```bash
NAME                STATUS   AGE
default             Active   3h8m
gatekeeper-system   Active   3h8m
kube-node-lease     Active   3h8m
kube-public         Active   3h8m
kube-system         Active   3h8m
```

Now going back to the whole VMs and Apps, let's look at nodes and deployments.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Result: In this example there are 2 node pools (agent and user), and they both have 2 nodes (4 total, think 4 VMs).

```bash
aks-agentpool-41166359-vmss000000   Ready    <none>   3h7m   vx.x.x
aks-agentpool-41166359-vmss000001   Ready    <none>   3h7m   vx.x.x
aks-userpool-41166359-vmss000000    Ready    <none>   3h7m   vx.x.x
aks-userpool-41166359-vmss000001    Ready    <none>   3h7m   vx.x.x
```
